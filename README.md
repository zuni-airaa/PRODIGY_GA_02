# PRODIGY_GA_02

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates text‑to‑image generation using **Stable Diffusion** and **DALL‑E‑mini**, two state‑of‑the‑art generative models. By providing descriptive prompts, the models generate unique and creative visuals, showcasing the potential of diffusion models in AI‑driven art and design.

##  Features
- Image generation from natural language prompts  
- Comparison between Stable Diffusion and DALL‑E‑mini outputs  
- Curated `prompts.txt` dataset for testing  
- Example outputs showcasing generated images  

##  Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` → Colab notebook for image generation  
- `data/` → Curated prompt dataset (`prompts.txt`)  
- `results/` → Generated image samples  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies  

##  Setup
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install diffusers transformers torch accelerate
```

Run the notebook in Google Colab or locally to generate images from prompts.

##  Example Usage
```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "A futuristic cityscape at sunset, highly detailed, digital art"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("results/sample_output.png")
```

##  Results

Here are some example outputs generated using Stable Diffusion:

**Prompt:**  
`A futuristic cityscape at sunset, highly detailed, digital art`

**Generated Output:**  
*(Image stored in `results/sample_output.png`)*

---

**Prompt:**  
`A watercolor painting of mountains and lakes`

**Generated Output:**  
*(Image stored in `results/sample_output2.png`)*

---

Sample outputs are stored in the `results/` folder for reference.
```

This mirrors Task‑01 exactly — same badge, headings, flow, and example usage — but adapted for image generation.  

Would you like me to also prepare a **matching LinkedIn post draft** for Task‑02, so your announcement looks consistent with Task‑01’s style?
